This is the updated version of KachitoJr28's whot game...
I made it responsive (go look it up if you dont know the meaning) and these are the changes i made:
I added breakpoints for 1024px, 768px and 500px
Cards, piles and text scale down on smaller screens
Layout gaps and paddings reduced for mobile
.player-hand wraps cards on small screens
So THATS IT!
And dont forget...YOU MUST DO THIS!!!
